### Abstract
Human body images encode plenty of useful biometric information, such as pupil color, gender, and weight. Among these, body weight is a good indicator of health conditions. Motivated by recent health science studies, this paper investigates the feasibility of analyzing body weight from two-dimensional (2D) frontal view human body images. The widely used body mass index (BMI) is employed as a measure of body weight. To investigate the problems at different levels of difficulties, three feasibility problems, from easy to hard, are studied. More specifically, a framework is developed for analyzing body weight from human body images. Computation of five anthropometric features is proposed for body weight characterization. Correlation is analyzed between the extracted anthropometric features and the BMI values, which validates the usability of the selected features. A visual-body-to-BMI dataset is collected and cleaned to facilitate the study, which contains 5900 images of 2950 subjects along with the labels corresponding gender, height, and weight. Some interesting results are obtained, demonstrating the feasibility of analyzing body weight from 2D body images. In addition, the proposed method outperforms two state-of-art facial image-based weight analysis approaches in most cases.
