### Abstract
A physically unclonable function (PUF) is a circuit of which the input-output behavior is designed to be sensitive to the random variations of its manufacturing process. This building block hence facilitates the authentication of any given device in a population of identically laid-out silicon chips, similar to the biometric authentication of a human. The focus and novelty of this paper is the development of efficient impersonation attacks on the following five Arbiter PUF-based authentication protocols: 1) the so-called Poly PUF protocol of Konigsmark et al. as published in the IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems in 2016; 2) the so-called OB-PUF protocol of Gao et al. as presented at the IEEE Conference PerCom 2016; 3) the so-called RPUF protocol of Ye et al. as presented at the IEEE Conference AsianHOST 2016; 4) the so-called LHS-PUF protocol of Idriss and Bayoumi as presented at the IEEE Conference RFID-TA 2017; and 5) the so-called PUF-FSM protocol of Gao et al. as published in the IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems in 2018. The common flaw of all five designs is that the use of lightweight obfuscation logic provides insufficient protection against machine-learning attacks.

### Abstract

To be prepared for the ‘Industry 4.0’-era, we propose a hierarchical framework comprising four tangible layers, which is designed to vertically integrate inter-organizational value networks, engineering value chain, manufacturing factories, etc. The conceptual framework allows us to efficiently implement a flexible and reconfigurable smart factory. However, we need to consider security inherent in existing (stand-alone) devices and networks as well as those that may arise in such integrations. Especially the existing solutions are insufficient to address these fundamental security concerns. Thus, we present a blockchain-based system for secure mutual authentication, BSeIn, to enforce fine-grained access control polices. The proposed system (with integrated attribute signature, multi-receivers encryption and message authentication code) is designed to provide privacy and security guarantees such as anonymous authentication, auditability, and confidentiality. BSeIn also scales well due to the utilization of smart contract. We then evaluate the security and performance of BSeIn. For example, findings from the performance evaluation demonstrate that Initialization/Request Issuance/Chain Transaction/State Delivery/Permission Update phase only cost 12.123/4.810/6.978/0.013/2.559s, respectively.
