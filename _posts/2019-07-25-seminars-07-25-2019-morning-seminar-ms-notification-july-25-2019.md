### Abstract
The real-time electricity consumption data can be used in value-added service such as big data analysis, meanwhile the single user's privacy needs to be protected. How to balance the data utility and the privacy preservation is a vital issue, where the privacy-preserving data aggregation could be a feasible solution. Most of the existing data aggregation schemes rely on a trusted third party (TTP). However, this assumption will have negative impact on reliability, because the system can be easily knocked down by the denial of service attack. In this paper, a practical privacy-preserving data aggregation scheme is proposed without TTP, in which the users with some extent trust construct a virtual aggregation area to mask the single user's data, and meanwhile, the aggregation result almost has no effect for the data utility in large scale applications. The computation cost and communication overhead are reduced in order to promote the practicability. Moreover, the security analysis and the performance evaluation show that the proposed scheme is robust and efficient.

### Abstract

To be prepared for the ‘Industry 4.0’-era, we propose a hierarchical framework comprising four tangible layers, which is designed to vertically integrate inter-organizational value networks, engineering value chain, manufacturing factories, etc. The conceptual framework allows us to efficiently implement a flexible and reconfigurable smart factory. However, we need to consider security inherent in existing (stand-alone) devices and networks as well as those that may arise in such integrations. Especially the existing solutions are insufficient to address these fundamental security concerns. Thus, we present a blockchain-based system for secure mutual authentication, BSeIn, to enforce fine-grained access control polices. The proposed system (with integrated attribute signature, multi-receivers encryption and message authentication code) is designed to provide privacy and security guarantees such as anonymous authentication, auditability, and confidentiality. BSeIn also scales well due to the utilization of smart contract. We then evaluate the security and performance of BSeIn. For example, findings from the performance evaluation demonstrate that Initialization/Request Issuance/Chain Transaction/State Delivery/Permission Update phase only cost 12.123/4.810/6.978/0.013/2.559s, respectively.
